# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - how finally behave in promise if finally is rejected the promise then only
    it will reflect.
- What changed in your understanding?
  - how finally behaves.
- What would you explain differently now?

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

  - async and await are still some confusions.
  - we are not declaring a variable inside a function then how 'this' is
    working.

Rules:

- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”
